The **custom strategy** is designed to generate trading signals based on a combination of technical indicators and predefined thresholds.

### **Key Components of the Custom Strategy**

#### 1. **Technical Indicators**
The strategy uses several technical indicators to evaluate market conditions and generate buy/sell signals. These indicators are configured in the `strategy` section of the config.yaml file:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
  - `rsi_period`: 14
  - `rsi_overbought`: 70 (indicates overbought conditions, potential sell signal)
  - `rsi_oversold`: 30 (indicates oversold conditions, potential buy signal)

- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
  - `macd_fast`: 12
  - `macd_slow`: 26
  - `macd_signal`: 9
  - Signals are generated based on bullish or bearish crossovers.

- **Bollinger Bands**:
  - `bb_period`: 20
  - `bb_std_dev`: 2.0
  - Signals are generated when the price touches the upper or lower bands.

- **Stochastic Oscillator**:
  - `stoch_k_period`: 14
  - `stoch_d_period`: 3
  - `stoch_smooth_k`: 3
  - Signals are generated based on bullish or bearish crossovers in overbought/oversold regions.

- **ATR (Average True Range)**:
  - `atr_period`: 14
  - `atr_multiplier`: 2.0
  - Used for calculating trailing stop-loss levels.

#### 2. **Signal Strength**
The strategy assigns a **signal strength** to each indicator's output. This strength is aggregated to determine the overall buy or sell signal.

- **Signal Strength Scale**:
  - Positive values indicate buy signals.
  - Negative values indicate sell signals.
  - The final signal strength is compared to a threshold (`signal_threshold`) to generate actionable signals.

- **Signal Threshold**:
  - Configured in config.yaml as `signal_threshold: 3`.
  - A buy signal is generated if the signal strength is greater than or equal to `3`.
  - A sell signal is generated if the signal strength is less than or equal to `-3`.

---

#### 3. **Volume Confirmation**
The strategy uses volume data to confirm signals:
- High volume strengthens buy or sell signals.
- This ensures that signals are backed by significant market activity.

---

#### 4. **Trailing Stop Parameters**
The strategy uses a trailing stop-loss mechanism to manage risk:
- Configured as `trailing_stop_pct: 1.0` in the `strategy` section.
- This ensures that profits are locked in while allowing trades to run as long as the market moves favorably.

### **How the Strategy Works**

1. **Indicator Calculation**:
   - The strategy calculates the values of all configured indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) for the given market data.

2. **Signal Generation**:
   - Each indicator contributes to the overall signal strength based on its conditions (e.g., RSI oversold adds to buy strength).
   - Volume data is used to confirm or strengthen signals.

3. **Buy/Sell Signal Determination**:
   - If the aggregated signal strength exceeds the `signal_threshold`, a **buy signal** is generated.
   - If the signal strength is below the negative threshold, a **sell signal** is generated.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - The strategy uses the trailing stop-loss mechanism to manage risk and protect profits.
   - It also respects the risk parameters defined in the `risk` section of the configuration (e.g., `max_position_size`, `max_open_positions`, `max_daily_loss`).

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Input Data**:
   - The strategy receives OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for a trading pair (e.g., `BTCUSDT`).

2. **Indicator Evaluation**:
   - RSI indicates oversold conditions → Adds to buy signal strength.
   - MACD shows a bullish crossover → Adds to buy signal strength.
   - Price touches the lower Bollinger Band → Adds to buy signal strength.

3. **Signal Strength Calculation**:
   - Aggregated signal strength = `4` (greater than the threshold of `3`).

4. **Buy Signal**:
   - A buy signal is generated for the trading pair.

5. **Risk Management**:
   - The position size is checked against `max_position_size`.
   - The number of open positions is checked against `max_open_positions`.
   - A trailing stop-loss is set based on the `atr_multiplier`.

### **Advantages of the Strategy**
1. **Multi-Indicator Approach**:
   - Combines multiple indicators for robust signal generation.
2. **Volume Confirmation**:
   - Ensures signals are backed by significant market activity.
3. **Risk Management**:
   - Uses trailing stop-loss and position size limits to minimize risk.
4. **Customizable**:
   - All parameters (e.g., indicator periods, thresholds) can be adjusted in config.yaml.
